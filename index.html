      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hey there! I'm a passionate and curious learner who’s always eager to explore the world of web development. 
        I'm currently diving deep into the MERN stack — MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js — with the goal of becoming a full-stack developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the way, I’ve developed a solid foundation in UI/UX design, which helps me build clean, user-friendly interfaces. 
        I believe that functionality and design go hand in hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve already built a few websites — from static pages to interactive apps. 
        Whether it’s solving a tricky bug, improving performance, or just making a layout more responsive, I enjoy the learning process.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m excited to take on new challenges and contribute to meaningful projects!
      </p>

          </h3>
          <p>
            Agrosha is a machine learning-based web application designed to help farmers and agricultural analysts predict crop yield with greater accuracy. 
            The app uses a two-stage model pipeline: the first model predicts key factors like Production, Rainfall, Fertilizer usage, and Pesticide levels based on inputs such as Crop, State, Season, Area, and Year. 
            These predictions are then passed into a second model that estimates the final crop yield.
          </p>
          <p>
            Agrosha is built using Python (Flask) for the backend and integrates trained ML models stored as `.pkl` files. 
            The app streamlines complex agricultural data into a user-friendly interface, making it easier for users to make informed decisions. 
            This project reflects my passion for solving real-world problems through technology and my growing experience in full-stack development and machine learning.
